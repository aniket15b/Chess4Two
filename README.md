# NQueensChess
A DataStructures course Project based on implementation of stacks. It presents a terminal interface made with ncurses. The objective is to place N-Queens on an NxN chessboard such that they do not attack each other. An undo command undoes the moves made. 
Requirements: ncurses must be installed.
On Ubuntu run,
>apt-get install libncurses5-dev 

>gcc -o -lncurses a main.c

>./a
